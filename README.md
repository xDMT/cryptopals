# cryptopals
This repo consists of my solutions to the Cryptopals challenges (https://cryptopals.com)

Also in the directory 'cryptoutils' you will find a collection of cryptographic programs
and utilities, unrelated to the challenges.

My latest contribution to that is a simple AES-128 encryption/decryption tool for use
with ECB mode. There is an install script include to manage the dependecies.
